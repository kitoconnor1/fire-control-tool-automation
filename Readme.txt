# fire-control-tool-automation
This project represents a collaboration between Wildlife and Human Dimensions programs within Rocky Mountain Research Station. The aim is to develop scripting (mainly R and Python) that automates steps required to fit and apply a predictive spatial model to inform investment of fire suppression efforts. The model uses various remotely sensed spatial data to explain and predict where past fire perimeters, i.e., where they stopped burning. Models have already been developed and applied in particular landscapes. The scripts in this repository are intended to automate data retrieval and compilation, model fitting, and generation of predictive maps for new landscapes.

Steps needed / completed:
1. Processing of DEMs into distance to TPI classes (done, Matt).
2. Calculating SDI layer (done, Matt).
